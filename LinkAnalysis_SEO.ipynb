    "*Goals of this homework:* Understand the vector space model (TF-IDF, cosine) + BM25 works in searching. Explore real-world challenges of building a graph (in this case, from Epinions), implement and test the classic HITS algorithm over this graph. Experiment with real-world search engine optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",

    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

A token that occurs twice in a 20 word document and 5 times in a 500 word document, then the shorter document will be more relevant than the longer document.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we're going to adapt the classic HITS approach to allow us to find not the most authoritative web pages, but rather to find the most trustworthy users. [Epinions.com](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Epinions1.html) is a general consumer review site with a who-trust-whom online social network. Members of the site can decide whether to ''trust'' each other. All the trust relationships interact and form the Web of Trust which is then combined with review ratings to determine which reviews are shown to the user. (Refer to: Richardson, Matthew, Rakesh Agrawal, and Pedro Domingos. \"Trust management for the semantic web.\" International semantic Web conference. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2003.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Epinions users and their \"trust\" on other users (so user = node, trust behavior = edge). Over this Epinions-user graph, we can apply the HITS approach to order the users by their hub-ness and their authority-ness.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to download the *Epinions_trust.txt* file from the Resources tab on Piazza. Each line represents the trust relationship between two users. Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* diane trust bob\n",
    "* charlie trust bob \n",
    "* charlie trust alice\n",
    "* bob trust charlie\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trust\" between each user pair denotes a directed edge between two nodes. E.g., the \"diane\" node has a directed edge to the \"bob\" node (as indicated by the first line). \n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph by parsing the data in the file we provide called *Epinions_trust.txt*. (Note: The edges are binary and directed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The edges are binary and directed.\n",
    "* User can't trust himself/herself.\n",

    "I kept the following in mind while trying to improve the ranking of my webpage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The website had to be mobile friendly: This meant my web page needed to load quickly, have easy to scan through content,adapt based on screen size and have clickable links spaced properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keyword frequency: This helps search engines judge the relevancy of a webpage to a query. If my keyword frequency was too low, then I would have trouble ranking for that keyword. However, if this was too high, that sends a negative signal to the search engines. \"Keyword stuffing\" (a blackhat technique) is a technique where the keyword frequency is unnaturally high and distracting to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* I added meta tags for description and keywords set as the given phrase because most search engines often display the meta description in search results which can highly influence user click-through rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Picked a short title for the page that contains the phrase: Both the title tag and the meta description together give a brief idea of what your content is about, but the title tag is displayed in the SERP and therfore, influences user-clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include an image or video on the page and annotate them with alt text set as the phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross-linking: Link popularity is one of the main factors involved in how search engines determine the value, importance and relevance of sites on a given topic. This calculation is then reflected in the site's search ranking. Cross linking allows users to reference sites with content similar to that which they are already viewing, and may be of further interest to them. So, I set up another webpage using Google sites, created a github repository called \"sajfd hfafbjhd\", uploaded a youtube video with the same name and then create links between them while keeping the following in mind :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >1)Using keyword rich anchor text around the cross linking.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >2)Avoid using cross linking on every page because it dilutes the quality of the link, and will appear questionable to the search engines.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >3)Avoid creating a \"link ring\". A link ring is when several sites are cross linking to each other, with no other sites linked into the ring they create. Search engines will penalize this kind of cross linking immediately.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        \n",
    "* I also added google-site-verification meta tag to verify ownership of the webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Share the page with people: Ranking of a webpage is influenced based on user engagement. Search engines monitor and remember user interactions. If a page consistently keeps people on them for longer than average, the algorithm will adjust the search results to favor that site.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regularly update the webpage: \"Freshness\" of a webpage is also something that search engines consider while ranking. So, I made sure I added new content/modifyied existing content to keep my page fresh.\n"
